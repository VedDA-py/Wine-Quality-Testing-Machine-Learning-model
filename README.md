# Wine Quality Prediction Model

## Description
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties of the wine.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on various physicochemical features of red and white wines, including their quality scores.

## Methodology
The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model training using supervised learning techniques. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

## Model Details
Multiple models were implemented, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and SVM. Each model's performance was evaluated based on confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports.

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset.
2. Run the preprocessing and feature engineering steps.
3. Train the model using the provided script.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation metrics.
